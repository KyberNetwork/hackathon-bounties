# Hackathon Bounties
We were blown away by the projects that integrated with Kyber at ETHSF, and are excited to see what ETHSG can bring!

## What is Kyber?
Kyber is a widely used on-chain protocol that makes accessing liquidity simple for users, DApps and financial applications. The protocol has powered decentralised token swaps on popular wallets like MyEtherWallet and imToken, decentralised token payments (users can pay in any supported ERC20 token) in popular DApps like Etheremon and Peepeth and providing an on-chain liquidity source for decentralised financial applications like MelonPort, Set Protocol, b0x and many more.

Kyber protocol brings token inventories and prices on-chain, hence allowing developers to directly embed value exchanges into their smart contracts without any technical or security overhead. This allows for:

- Instant confirmation. A transaction happens with instant confirmation if it's sent from on-chain entities like smart contracts. Otherwise, once the transaction is included on the blockchain, the execution triggered by the transaction is immediately confirmed.

- Operation certainty. There is no transactional risk. Users know the rate and how much liquidity is available before they commit their transaction. There is also no settlement uncertainty or counterparty risk.

- Global and diverse pool of different tokens. Kyber welcomes token holders to contribute their token to the liquidity pool. By having their token made available to the liquidity pool, the token will be available in all services integrated with Kyber.

## What can you #BUIDLwithKyber?

### Instant token swaps
Embed simple and atomic ERC20 <-> ERC20 token swaps in your application.

### Single Step Payments
Expand your payment options for your users by accepting not just ETH, but ERC20 tokens too. Empower your users with the freedom of choice in pay in their favourite tokens. [Peepeth](https://peepeth.com/a/crowdfunding) and [Etheremon](https://hackernoon.com/etheremon-integrates-with-kybers-on-chain-liquidity-protocol-a-new-payment-solution-for-ccbb36dfd595) are but some examples.

### On-chain Fund Rebalancing
Achieve seamless liquidation of assets for immediate rebalancing of portfolios in a single transaction. Take a look at [b0x](https://medium.com/@b0xNet/kyber-bzx-b6f5330289a6) and [Betoken](https://medium.com/betoken/6-primordial-reasons-to-build-a-decentralized-hedge-fund-with-kyber-1bbb3ed6a4d9) for a glimpse of what is possible!

### Arbitrage Programs
Take advantage of market inefficiencies, since prices are not always the same across different price discovery venues, especially between off-chain and on-chain prices. Help improve price equilibrium across the market whilst profiting from it!


If you need more ideas on what you can build, take a look at the bounties below!

## Bounties
### Simple Swap Interface on IPFS
Create a static website hosted on IPFS that interact with Kyber's smart contracts via Infura.

### [Collateral Liquidation On-Chain](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/1)
Lending platforms such as ETHLend, Dharma and Bloqboard allow for ERC20 tokens to be put as collateral. In the event of a loan default, allow the lender to perform liqudation of collateral into the token of his choice whilst withdrawing it into his account.

### [Off-Chain Virtual Orderbook Relayer](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/2)
Reconstruct an orderbook by extracting information from Kyber's reserves (denoted as on-chain orders), while allowing users to create off-chain orders. It'll be interesting to see how settlement occurs between an on-chain and off-chain order.

### Status
See if there's something we can do together

### [Integration with MakerDAO's Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/3)
Allow CDPs to be closed with ERC20 tokens.

### [Arbitrage Programs](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/4)
Make a DApp that takes advantage of market inefficiencies between Kyber and another venue! Take the bounty, keep the profit!


## [Open Category](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/hackathon-bounties/issues/5)
If you have your own idea that integrates with our protocol, why not apply for the official API prize? Dive into our tech, utilize it in a cool way and show us!

## Prizes
Stand to win $2000 SGD worth of KNC tokens for each bounty. The official API prize has a higher prize pool of $3000 SGD worth of KNC tokens!

## Judging Criteria
### 1. Idea
The importance of Kyber's protocol in the application, & originality of the idea.

### 2. User Experience
Intuitive, easy to use and interact with.

### 3. Technical Difficulty
Going above and beyond of what we specified. Good code quality, bug free, with thorough documentation.

### 4. Usability
Other projects are able to build on top of your application, or incorporate it into their own.

### 5. X Factor
Something that makes us go "Wow!"
