# Hackathon Bounties

After witnessing the cool projects built at hackathons like ETHBerlin, we cannot wait to see what future hackathons can offer! There is a strong spirit of collaboration at these events, and we hope to further promote this ideal through the bounties we are offering. To get an idea of the kind of collaboration going on, take a look at [InstaDapp](https://ethindia.conteract.io/), a project put together in ETHIndia, where they won MakerDAO's first prize bounty of $3k in DAI.

Our bounties have the core idea of leveraging our protocol for use in other projects.
