# Hackathon Bounties

After witnessing the cool projects built at hackathons like ETHBerlin, we cannot wait to see what future hackathons can offer! There is a strong spirit of collaboration at these events, and we hope to further promote this ideal through the bounties we are offering. To get an idea of the kind of collaboration going on, take a look at [InstaDapp](https://ethindia.conteract.io/), a project put together in ETHIndia, where they won MakerDAO's first prize bounty of $3k in DAI.

Our bounties have the core idea of leveraging our protocol for use in other projects.

## Getting Started

#### Check the GitHub issues for a list of bounties
Check out the GitHub issues in this repository for some of our proposed bounties for the hackathon.

#### Create a GitHub repo for the bounty
Please create a new GitHub repo for the bounty you'll be working on to make it easier for us to see the team members involved in the project. Ensure that all team members are visible publicly so we know who to pay the prizes to.

#### Need guides?
Our [developer portal](https://developer.kyber.network/) is the place to go!
In particular, do check out our [DApp Integration Guide!](https://developer.kyber.network/docs/DappsGuide/)
